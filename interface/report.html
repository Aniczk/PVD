      <h1>Basic information.</h1>
      <p>Molecular weight for TPH1 and COMT are respectively 50984.583 and 30036.712 (in daltons)</p>
      <p>Grand average of hydropathicity index (GRAVY) represents the hydrophobicity value of a peptide. Positive GRAVY values indicate hydrophobic, negative values mean hydrophilic.</p>
      <p>GRAVY value for TPH1 is -0.449 and for COMT equals 0.16</p>

      <h1>Flexibility</h1>
      <p>Proteins are dynamic entities, and they possess an inherent flexibility that allows them to function through molecular interactions within the cell, among cells and even between organisms</p>
      <p>Here, flexibility is presented from Vihinien et.al (1994, Proteins, 19, 141-149.) method</p>

      <h1>Secondary structure</h1>
      <p>Represented as occurrence of three ways the protein can fold within secondary structure.</p>

      <h1>Isoelectric point and aromaticity.</h1>
      <p>Isoelectric point it is the pH at which a protein contains on average the same number of positive and negative charges.</p>
      <p>The presence of aromatic amino acids in seq [%]. Based on frequency of Phe+Trp+Tyr.</p>

      <h1>Molar extinction coefficient.</h1>
      <p>Calculates the molar extinction coefficient assuming cysteines (reduced) and cystines residues (Cys-Cys-bond)</p>
      <p>The molar attenuation coefficient is a measurement of how strongly a chemical species attenuates light at a given wavelength.</p>

      <h1>Instability of proteins.</h1>
      <p>Measuring stability of the proteins. Any value above 40 means the protein is unstable, which means it has a short half life</p>
