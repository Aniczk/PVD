TODO LIST


1. Our main goal is to create "user-friendly" webserver that allows to create HTML report.
    - HTML report will contain descirption of protein or proteins and their comparision
    - User will be able to put, as an input, and ID of the FASTA sequence or list of IDS
    - Webserver works only with Uniprot database
    - We also would like to allow the User to choose which proteins characteristics should be included in the HTML report

2. Project should be split to different, main tasks, such as:
    a) Downloading from the database proteins that User select (FASTA format)
    b) Create specific and efficient data structure from protein sequences
    c) Perform algorithms to analyze the protein (avarage length, isoelectric point, aromaticity, etc.)
    d) Visualize the analyze of the protein and present it as the HTML format
    e) Create GUI (HTML) on the webserver that allows User to select: protein or list of protein IDs, characteristics to analyze, comparsion options.

3. Also there is a need of doing tests, provide test data and usage. Webserver will be put on student's server.
